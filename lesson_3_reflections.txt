1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than keep all my data local incase I want to collaborate with other people, or if I work from multiple systems.

2) Why would you always want to pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I wouldn't want git to automatically keep me up-to-date as I would be using my local repository to make experimental changed and use the remote repository only when I want to sync code between devices or when I'm ready to a feature public

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When do you use one instead of the other?

Branches are used to create working experimental changes from the main branch, they are created inside our repositories. Cloning is used to make a replica of a repository on our local machine from another place on the same machine or GitHub as well. Fork is when we clone a GitHub repository from another account into our account, This is a github only term and it's used to attribute the project the original creator and it's easier than to clone and add a remote and then push and then let others clone it again.
